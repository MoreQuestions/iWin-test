```dataview

  length(filter(rows, (r) => r.status = "Active")) as "Active",
  round(length(filter(rows, (r) => r.status = "Done" AND r.completed_date >= date(today) - dur(7 days))) / (length(filter(rows, (r) => r.status = "Done" AND r.completed_date >= date(today) - dur(7 days))) + length(filter(rows, (r) => r.status = "Active"))) * 100, 1) + "%" as "Completion Rate"
FROM ""
WHERE type = "Task"
GROUP BY "This Week"
```

**Tip**: Review cancelled/abandoned items quarterly. Were they worth starting?
