# Weekly Planning Habit

Every Sunday, review the week and plan the next week.

## Steps
- [ ] Review [[🏆 Wins]] from past week
- [ ] Check [[📆 This Week]] dashboard
- [ ] Move unfinished tasks to next week or Someday
- [ ] Review [[📥 Inbox]] and process items
- [ ] Plan 3 most important tasks for upcoming week
- [ ] Set time blocks for P2 (Important but not Urgent) tasks

## Success Criteria
- Inbox at zero
- Next week's top 3 priorities identified
- Feel clear and focused about upcoming week

## Notes
This is a **P2 task** — Important but Not Urgent. These are the tasks that often get skipped but have the most long-term impact.

This demonstrates:
- **recurrence**: Weekly habit
- **review_date**: When to check in
- **energy**: "Low" means it doesn't require peak focus
