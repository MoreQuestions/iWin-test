## 🎯 Philosophy

**"Done is better than perfect"**

- 30-minute/month optimization limit
- MVP approach: Start simple, add only when needed
- Use the system, don't endlessly perfect it
- Zero-friction capture → AI classification → Get things done

## 🤝 Built With Claude Code

This entire system was designed and built through a collaborative process with Claude Code, using:

- Multi-agent parallel research
- Architectural planning
- Obsidian vault construction
- Script development
- Documentation creation

**Total build time**: ~2 hours
**Alternative (SwiftUI app)**: Would have taken 100-300 hours
