# P4 â€” Neither Urgent nor Important

**Priority Level:** 4 (Lowest)
**Urgency:** Low
**Impact:** Low

---

## Description

Tasks with little time pressure and minimal impact. Consider whether they should be done at all.

## Examples
- Nice-to-have features
- Wishlist items
- Low-value busy work
- Distractions disguised as tasks

## Strategy
- Do only when all higher priorities are clear
- Regularly review and delete
- Ask: "What happens if I never do this?"
- Many P4 tasks should be deleted, not completed
