# Master List â€” All Items Database

This is the conceptual "Master List" containing all tasks, notes, ideas, bookmarks, and projects.

In Obsidian, the Master List is not a single file but rather **all notes in the vault** with proper frontmatter properties.

---

## Properties Schema

Every item in IWin has these frontmatter properties:

```yaml
---
# Core Properties
title: "Item title"
type: "Task | Note | Idea | Bookmark | Project"
priority: "[[P1]] | [[P2]] | [[P3]] | [[P4]]"
area: "[[Work]] | [[Personal]] | [[Learning]] | [[Health]] | [[Finance]] | [[Social]]"
time_bucket: "Today | This Week | This Month | Someday | Waiting"

# Organization
tags: []
lists: []
status: "Active | Done | Cancelled | Abandoned | Archived | Ongoing"
visibility: "Active | Hidden"

# Workflow
processed_by_ai: false
origin_item: null
related_items: []

# Bookmarks (if type: Bookmark)
url: ""
resolved_title: ""
site: ""
favicon_path: ""

# Tasks (if type: Task)
energy: "High | Medium | Low"
due_date: null
review_date: null
snooze_until: null
success_criteria: ""
recurrence: ""

# Metadata

## Usage

**Don't edit this file.** Instead:

1. Create new notes anywhere in the vault
2. Add frontmatter properties
3. Dataview queries will aggregate all notes into dashboards

**Example Task:**

```markdown
---
title: "Finish IWin setup"
type: "Task"
priority: "[[P1]]"
area: "[[Personal]]"
time_bucket: "Today"
tags: [productivity, obsidian]
status: "Active"
visibility: "Active"
processed_by_ai: true
energy: "Medium"
created: 2025-10-18

# Finish IWin setup

Set up the full IWin system with Claude Code.

## Steps
- [x] Research approach
- [x] Choose platform (Obsidian)
- [ ] Complete setup
- [ ] Test workflows
```

---

## Dataview Queries

Access the Master List via Dataview:

```dataview
TABLE type, priority, area, time_bucket, status
FROM ""
WHERE type != null
SORT created DESC
```

Or use the pre-built dashboards in `/Dashboards`.
